# bns_ppr_scripts
Set of scripts for post-processing and analysis of the WhiskyTHC numerical relativity code, in particular the data from the HYDRO thorn

This is an old repository used to experiment with the simulations produced by WhikyTHC numerical relativity code in my PhD. The code is neither maintained nor documented. It is purely for experiments.
